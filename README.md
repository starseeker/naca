   NACA++ - A C++ Library for Generating Coordinates of NACA Airfoils
                              Version 1.0

NACA++ is a C++ library for the calculation of coordinates for NACA
airfoils, based on the public domain program naca456 written by Ralph
Carmichael of Public Domain Aeronautical Software (PDAS):

http://www.pdas.com/naca456.html

naca456 is in turn based off of earlier work by several authors at NASA,
documented in reports NASA TM X-3284, NASA TM X-3069 and NASA TM 4741.  The
program naca456 is documented in the paper:

Carmichael, Ralph L.: Algorithm for Calculating Coordinates of Cambered NACA
Airfoils At Specified Chord Locations. AIAA Paper 2001-5235, November 2001.
