            DESCRIPTION OF THE INPUT DATA FOR NACA6

 The input data is all in one namelist record. One nice feature
 of namelist input is that you may put comments before the actual data.
 Just be sure you don't say the magic word &INPUT6 in your comments.
 Many of the sample cases I have supplied have comments before the
 main data.



  NAMELIST /INPUT6/ A, CHD, CLI, CMBNMR, NAME, SERIEC, SERIET, TOC


   NAME      Title desired on printed output, enclosed in quotes
   PROFILE   NACA airfoil family (series 63 thru 67 and 63A thru 65A)
               This is a character variable (max length=3) and must
               be enclosed in quotes. Acceptable values are '63',
               '64','65','66','67','63A','64A','65A'. The A must
               be upper case.
   CAMBER    Camber line. This is a character variable (max length=4)
               and must be enclosed in quotes. Acceptable values are
               '63','64','65','66','67','63A','64A','65A', and 'NONE'.
               The A must be upper case.

   TOC       Thickness-chord ratio of airfoil (fraction, not percent)
   RLE       Leading-edge radius may be entered if desired
               (not used in program, totally ignored ??)
   CHD       Model chord used for listing ordinates in dimensional units
               (default value=1)
   CMBNMR    Number of mean lines to be summed (max #=10)
   CLI       Array of CMBNMR design lift coefficients
   A         Array of CMBNMR mean line chordwise loading
               (use 0.8 for 6A-series)



  DESCRIPTION OF THE OUTPUT FROM NACA6

  There are two files produced by NACA6. The first, which is intended
  to be read on your screen or printed is named naca6.out.
  The second is a bare data file named naca6.plt consisting of
  a table of points defining the airfoil. This airfoil will have a
  length of CHD (default=1.0). The points begin at the trailing edge of
  the lower surface and proceed forward along the lower side of the
  airfoil around the leading edge and back along the upper surface to
  the trailing edge of the upper surface. The airfoils all have a slightly
  blunt trailing edge, so the final point will not be quite the same
  as the initial point.
  This file is intended to be piped to another
  part of your analysis or to a plotting routine. If you use
  gnuplot (can't be beat for price/performance) you can show the
  airfoil with the command > plot "naca6.plt" with lines.
  This will exaggerate the vertical scale to fill the screen. If
  you want to see the actual shape, say set yrange[-y:y] where y=CHD/2.
  The next version of gnuplot should have a command set shape square.
