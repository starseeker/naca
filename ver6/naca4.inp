 The input data is all in one namelist record. One nice feature
 of namelist input is that you may put comments before the actual data.
 Just be sure you don't say the magic word &INPUT4 in your comments.
 The sample cases I have supplied have comments before the main data
 to explain the case.

 NAMELIST /INPUT4/ NAME, PROFILE, CAMBER, TOC, RLE, DX, CHD, XM,
     &                  D1, CMB, CM, K2OK1, CLI, A, CMBNMR

 The variables have the following meanings:

   NAME     Title desired on output. It must be enclosed in quotes.
   PROFILE  Thickness family name, enclosed in quotes
              Acceptable values are '4-DIGIT' and '4-DIGITMOD'.
              The name MUST be in capital letters.
   CAMBER   Name of the camber line, enclosed in quotes
              Acceptable values are 'NONE', '2-DIGIT', 3-DIGIT',
              '3-DIGITREF', '6-SERIES' and '6A-SERIES'
              The name MUST be in capital letters.
   TOC      Thickness-chord ratio of airfoil (fraction, not percent)
   RLE      Leading-edge radius, as a fraction of chord.
             (Not used with 4-digit but used with 4-digit modified.)
   DX       Basic chordwise increment in x/c for computing ordinates.
              (default value is 0.01)
              (don't make this too small, or some tables will overflow)
   CHD      Model chord used for listing ordinates in dimensional units.
              (default value is 1. If CHD is 1, no additional printout
               is made)
   XM       Chordwise location of maximum thickness, as fraction of chord.
              ( Only used for 4-digit modified airfoils)
   D1       Trailing-edge slope of 4-digit modified airfoils.
            Input D1=0 to use the standard NACA value.
            [Note: This is a positive number, so it is more accurately
             called the magnitude of the trailing-edge slope.]
   CMB      Camber ordinate parameter.
            For 2-digit camber lines, CMB is the maximum camber ordinate,
            as a fraction of chord.
            For 3-digit camber lines, CMB is the value of k1 (which varies
            with the design lift coefficient). Consult the table.
            For 3-digit-reflex camber lines, CMB is the value of k1
            (which varies with design lift coefficient, but is not the
            same as k1 for three-digit camber lines)
            CMB is ignored for camber lines of type 6-SERIES,6A-SERIES
            and NONE.

   CM       Camber position parameter.
            For two-digit camber lines, CM is the chordwise position of
            maximum camber, as a fraction of chord.
            For three-digit camber lines, CM is the value of r, which is
            related to the chordwise position of maximum camber.
            For three-digit-reflex camber lines, CM is the value of r,
            which is related to the chordwise position of maximum camber.
            (but it is a different r than 3-digit)
            See tables for NACA values.
            CM is ignored for camber lines of type 6-SERIES,6A-SERIES
            and NONE.

   K2OK1    The quantity k2/k1 in the equations for the three-digit-reflex
            camber line. See table.
            This quantity is ignored for all other camber lines.

   CMBNMR   number of 6-series or 6A-series camber lines to be summed.
            This quantity is ignored for all other camber lines
            (max=10)

   CLI      a table of CMBNMR values of design CL.
              ( Only applies to 6-series and 6A-series camber lines)
   A        a table of CMBNMR values of weighting factors for the
              camber lines defined by CLI. (again, only applies to
              6-digit camber lines )
              [Note: Always use A=0.8 for 6A-series camber lines.]





ADDITIONAL NOTES ON INPUT

  If the airfoil is a 4-digit modified one, then one must provide values
  of RLE and D1 as well as XM and TOC. The value of RLE is related to the
  leading index, which is the first digit after the hyphen in the airfoil
  designation. The file called table1.tbl contains values of RLE for index
  values 1 thru 8 for t/c=0.05 thru 0.21. The value of D1 which determines
  the trailing edge angle is given by the following table:
       XM     D1
      0.2    0.200
      0.3    0.234
      0.4    0.315
      0.5    0.465
      0.6    0.700

  The three digit camber lines require two parameters which are input with
  the namelist variables CM and CMB. The values of CM and CMB for the three
  digit lines are given in the following table:

    line      CM      CMB
    210     0.0580   361.4
    220     0.1260    51.64
    230     0.2025    15.957
    240     0.2900     6.643
    250     0.3910     3.230

  The three digit reflex lines require three parameters which are input with
  the namelist variables CM, CMB, and K1OK2.

    line      CM      CMB     K2OK1
    221     0.1300    51.99   .000764
    231     0.2170    15.793  .00677
    241     0.3180     6.520  .0303
    251     0.4410     3.191  .1355



  DESCRIPTION OF THE OUTPUT FROM NACA4

  There are two files produced by NACA4. The first, which is intended
  to be read on your screen or printed is named naca4.out.
  The second is a bare data file named naca4.plt consisting of
  a table of points defining the airfoil. This airfoil will have a
  length of CHD (default=1.0). The points begin at the trailing edge of
  the lower surface and proceed forward along the lower side of the
  airfoil around the leading edge and back along the upper surface to
  the trailing edge of the upper surface. The airfoils all have a slightly
  blunt trailing edge, so the final point will not be quite the same
  as the initial point.
  This file is intended to be piped to another
  part of your analysis or to a plotting routine. If you use
  gnuplot (can't be beat for price/performance) you can show the
  airfoil with the command > plot "naca4.plt" with lines.
  This will exaggerate the vertical scale to fill the screen. If
  you want to see the actual shape, say set yrange[-y:y] where y=CHD/2.
